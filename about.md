### Intro
Hi, I am Michal. I am a Data Scientist, Engineer, and Entrepreneur with experience leading data science at early-stage start-ups and managing $10MM+ technology projects for Fortune 500 companies.

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at Bellman Labs LLC, a consulting company started by myself and a group of close friends. Bellman Labs helps companies scope projects, build teams and strategize in areas of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

I am obsessed with Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, but I also love building small statistical models and getting my hands dirty with data mining and exploratory analysis.

I enjoy the high-level product vision discussion as much as leading the implementation.

<!-- In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my wife Heather and son Amber. I am the winner of season 3 of the reality TV show "King of the Nerds." As a hobby I enjoy mixing technology and humor, leading to the creation of things like TweetMashup.com and AI generated license plates. -->

### My Story
* At 2, started using computer - MS Windows 95, my favorite game was Tetris.
* At 6, started learning English.
* At 12, got a scooter, after few months modified the engine with my brother to increase the top speed from 50km/h to 90km/h.(without our parent's permission).
* At 15, visited the US for the first time and fell in love with this country.
* At 16, started racing in [European Scooter Trophy](https://www.europeanscootertrophy.de/en/).
* At 17, built with my brother in our garage a motorcycle inertial dynometer, then tested to handle power measurements of track-ready Honda CBR 1000cc at ~300km/h. Still in our home garage... (our neighbors weren't too happy).
* At 18, got my first paid programming job, building a website for a Interior Architecture store.
* At 19, moved to the US to study Mechanical Engineering at [Stevens Institute of Technology](stevens.edu).
* At 23, got my first job as a Data Scientist at my friend's start-up [Woofy - AI-Driven Social Media Marketing Platform](hellowoofy.com).
