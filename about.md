### Currently
I run my consulting business - Bellman labs, helping start-ups decide on the areas of their business and product that machine learning can improve and support their Data Science efforts. I am obsessed with Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.


### My Story
* At 2, started using computer - MS Windows 95, my favorite game was Tetris
* At 6, started learning English
* At 12, got a scooter, after few months tuned the engine with my brother to increase the top speed from 50km/h to 90km/h.(without our parent's permission)
* At 15, visited the US for the first time and fell in love with this country
* At 16, started racing in [European Scooter Trophy](https://www.europeanscootertrophy.de/en/)
* At 17, built with my brother in our garage a motorcycle inertial dynometer, then tested to handle power measurements of track-ready Honda CBR 1000cc at ~300km/h. Still in our home garage... (our neighbors weren't too happy)
* At 18, got my first paid programming job, building a website for a Interior Architecture store
* At 19, moved to the US to study Mechanical Engineering at [Stevens Institute of Technology](stevens.edu)
* At 23, got my first job as a Data Scientist at my friend's start-up [Woofy - AI-Driven Social Media Marketing Platform](hellowoofy.com)
