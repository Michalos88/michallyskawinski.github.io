title: Hello!

Hi, I am Michal. I am a Data Scientist, Engineer, and Entrepreneur with experience leading data science at early-stage start-ups and managing $10MM+ technology projects for Fortune 500 companies.

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at Bellman Labs LLC, a consulting company started by myself and a group of close friends. Bellman Labs helps companies scope projects, build teams and strategize in areas of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

I am obsessed with Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, but I also love building small statistical models and getting my hands dirty with data mining and exploratory analysis.

I enjoy the high-level product vision discussion as much as leading the implementation.
