title: Hello!
---

AI enthusiast by day, adventure seeker by night (well, not literally, but you get the idea!). I'm Michal, and I'm passionate about building impactful products with AI, from helping people to buy their dream homes to unraveling the mysteries of intelligence.

I've tinkered with pricing models for startups, built content generation models way before LLMs, and even delved into the world of reinforcement learning research (ever heard of AlphaGo?). My latest project? Rosetta Analytics, an AI hedge fund that's poised to change the world of investing.

But hey, I'm not all algorithms and equations. When I'm not geeking out over newest tech or models, you can find me discussing the latest F1 races, getting lost in the beauty of modern art, or diving deep into the world of crypto and wellness. Basically, I'm a curious soul up for anything, as long as it involves interesting conversations and maybe a good glass of wine.

So, whether you're an AI aficionado, a Max Verstappen fan, or just someone with a story to share, hit me up! I'm always down to connect and see where the conversation takes us.
