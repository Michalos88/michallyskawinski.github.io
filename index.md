title: Hello!
---

Currently, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Rosetta Analytics, a deep-tech start-up, focused on building autonomous investment strategies for active asset management.
Previously, I was a Machine Learning Consultant at Up&Up, Data Scientist at Woofy, and the co-founder of a healthcare company called Hippo.

I am Polish, I like motorcycles, art and Japanese stuff. I do well with high complexity, and I am a curious thinker.
